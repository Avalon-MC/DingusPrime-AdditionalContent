## What is this

DingusPrime ACM is a mod to house additional custom content / code / any required additions for the DingusPrime modpack and server.

It currently contains: 
* A custom type for KubeJS to create handheld GameBoy like items
* A custom type for KubeJS to create handheld cartridges for the use with the handhelds
* A custom registry for ROMs to map between cart items and files
* A GBStudio made 'game' (defaultrom.gb) to serve as a fallback when the game rom isnt loadable (missing file, not registered, no cart in handheld)
* * Simple one screen 'game' that says there is no cart.



* A Clone of the KubeJS 6 cardinal block type. This is not availible in KubeJS 5.5 for 1.18.2 and we need it


### Upcoming Features
* Some sort of KubeJS defineable Shop that intergrates into Calemi's Economy. Max 3 items availible. Cycles every server / RL day


### How to use this?
Wiki Pages coming later as I'm still developing basic features. However, everything will be handled by KubeJS scripts
