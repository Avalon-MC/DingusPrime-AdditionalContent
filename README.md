## What is this

DingusPrime ACM is a mod to house additional custom content / code / any required additions for the DingusPrime modpack and server.
 We intend to use this alongside our other mod ContentSync to allow us to update KubeJS scripts for this mod, without needing major pack updates.


It currently contains: 
* A custom type for KubeJS to create handheld GameBoy like items
* A custom type for KubeJS to create handheld cartridges for the use with the handhelds
* A custom registry for ROMs to map between cart items and files
* A GBStudio made 'game' (defaultrom.gb) to serve as a fallback when the game rom isnt loadable (missing file, not registered, no cart in handheld)
* * Simple one screen 'game' that says there is no cart.

* A Clone of the KubeJS 6 cardinal block type. This is not availible in KubeJS 5.5 for 1.18.2 and we need it for custom blocks.

* A set of 18 Villager Trade NPCs for use in custom shops. They don't move around and have most of their AI removed.
* * Configurable using KubeJS scripts
* * Intergrates into Calemi's Economy.
* * Max of 3 items random available each 'day'.
* * Always available items supported.
* * Cycles available items every 24 hours or every server restart.
